## 🌀💖 **Project Idea: Forest Explorers!**

### 🧠 What's the Project?

This project is all about exploring the incredible world of forests — from lush rainforests to ancient woodlands. You'll investigate the threats they face (like deforestation) and the hope offered by reforestation projects around the world. You might use real data, tell digital stories, or build interactive creations that inspire others to protect our planet's lungs.

---

### 💡 Project Ideas

#### 🟢 **Data Detectives**

- Use a [dataset](#download-the-csv-file-click-the-picture) to explore deforestation and reforestation trends.
- Create visualizations in Python or a spreadsheet to show how forests have changed over time.
- Ask: _Where are forests disappearing the fastest? Where are trees being planted? What does this mean for the planet?_

#### 🟢 **Interactive Website or App**

- Build a **forest awareness site** using HTML/CSS/JS or a simple site builder.
- Include links to similar webpages about environmental issues or Scratch projects.
- Add links to real-life reforestation charities and tips for helping protect forests.

#### 🟢 **Forest Hero Game (Scratch or Python)**

- Make a game where the player protects a forest by planting trees, stopping fires, or removing litter.
- Add levels showing different forest types in the backdrops (e.g., rainforest, coniferous, temperate).
- Could be action-based or a calm sim game focused on balance and biodiversity.

#### 🟢 **Digital Art and Animations**

- Use digital tools like photo editors or animation apps to create posters or short animated videos about forest conservation.
- Turn satellite forest maps into **digital collages**.

#### 🟢 **AI for Forests**

- Create a simple chatbot that teaches people facts about forests and how to help using [ML4Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets).

### 🎯 Links to the Real World

- Learn about the role of forests in absorbing carbon and protecting wildlife.
- Research and contact organisations which are helping forests and the animals living in them.
- Look for ways to help trees, woods and animals in your own local area.

---

### 🌀 Really Shake It Up!

🔍🌍🎮🌲📈🧑‍💻🌱🎥
Try combining nature and tech in unexpected ways:

- Make your own **animal-camera-trap** with a raspberry pi, camera and pir sensor.
- Build a **forest mood app** that changes background and music based on country names input by users.
- Reimagine a **forest of the future** using generative AI or artistic apps.
- Collaborate with others to launch a mini **help the environment** website at school.

---

### 🌱 **Local Connections: Why This Matters to Me**

Think about this!

- What items in our school and homes come from trees? (paper, furniture, fruit, books)
- Do I use any products linked to deforestation (e.g. palm oil, beef, soy)?
- Are there trees or wooded areas near me? Where are they? Which can I visit?
- What animals live in or around local trees? How can we find out?
- How can school life help protect forests? (e.g. buying paper from sustainable forests, tree planting)

---

### 📊 **Data Collection & Analysis Ideas**

#### 🌳 _In My Area_

- Count and map the number of trees around the school or on the walk home.
- Record types of trees or estimate their age with simple methods.
- Count birds, insects, or squirrels seen near trees - do some trees support more types of life? Are these trees more valuable than others?
- Interview families: How often do we use paper? Where does our wood come from?
- Run a tree survey: “What’s your favourite tree and why?”

#### 📈 _Analyse & Share_

- Make graphs from local data (Excel, 2Graph, Python).
- Create bar charts comparing areas with many or few trees.
- Compare tree data from local green spaces - what types of tree are growing locally?

---

### 🦉 **Explore Animals and Trees**

- Research UK (or local) animals that rely on trees: bats, owls, red squirrels, insects, bees, birds.
- Build a Scratch project that follows an animal losing its tree home.
- Write a Python quiz about animals and their tree habitats.
- Use Sway to create a life-in-a-tree project.
