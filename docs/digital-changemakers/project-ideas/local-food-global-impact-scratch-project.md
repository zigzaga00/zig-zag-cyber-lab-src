## 🌀💖 **Local Food, Global Impact (Scratch Version)**

Help your community understand where food comes from — and how we can all make better choices for the planet!

---

### 🎯 Big Idea

Food often travels thousands of miles before it reaches our plate. That means fuel, pollution, and big carbon footprints! What if YOU could create a Scratch project that helps others learn about food miles — and inspires them to eat more local, seasonal food?

---

### 🎮 Project Goals

Use Scratch to build something interactive that:  
✅ Shows how far food travels  
✅ Teaches why local food matters  
✅ Gives tips or quizzes on how to help  
✅ Inspires others to take action

---

### 🧠 You Could Make...

🗺️ **Food Miles Quiz Game**

> Players guess how far different foods travel to reach the UK. Animate journeys on a world map!

🚚 **From Farm to Fork Animation**

> Show how a banana travels from a farm to the supermarket — with carbon-counting facts!

🌱 **Local vs Global Game**

> A player must quickly "catch" local foods and avoid imported ones — score points for planet-friendly picks!

📦 **Food Miles Tracker**

> Ask users questions about what they ate today, then calculate their food mile total with Scratch variables!

💡 **Tip Machine**

> An interactive Scratch spinner that gives players one thing they can do this week to lower food miles.

👩‍🍳 **Local Recipe Recommender**

> A Scratch project that asks a few fun questions and then recommends a delicious seasonal recipe using local ingredients.

🍓 **Build-a-Meal Game**

> Players drag ingredients to build a meal. If they choose local foods, they earn eco-points! If they choose far-away items, their carbon score rises!

🧑‍🏫 **Food Swap Advisor**

> A Scratch guide that helps swap ingredients in popular recipes for lower-mile or seasonal alternatives — e.g., berries instead of bananas!

### 💻 You might need these **Technique Cards**

- 🐱 [Technique Card: Broadcasting and Receiving Messages in Scratch (practical)](../../scratch/technique-cards-practical/broadcast-message-scratch.md) (for animations and quizzes)
- 🐱 [Technique Card: Variables in Scratch (practical)](../../scratch/technique-cards-practical/variables-scratch.md) (for score-keeping or calculations)
- 🐱 [Technique Card: Using Lists in Scratch (practical)](../../scratch/technique-cards-practical/lists-scratch.md) (if you’re storing different foods and their distances)
- 🐱 [Technique Card: Scratch Costumes and Backdrops (practical)](../../scratch/technique-cards-practical/costumes-scratch-practical.md) (to switch scenes and tell a story)

### 🔄 Simplify it!

New to Scratch? Try just one idea:

> Create a short animation showing a tomato grown in the UK vs one flown from Spain. Use speech bubbles and fun facts!

---

### 🧪 Make it your own!

🌍 Add real data — look up how far foods travel using websites like [foodmiles.com](https://www.foodmiles.com/)

🎭 **Add a Narrator Character**

> Bring in a friendly guide (like a talking tomato or globe!) who explains facts, gives tips, or celebrates the player's eco-choices.

📱 **Make It Look Like an App**

> Use Scratch backdrops and buttons to make your project feel like a real mobile app that helps people choose local food.

🌦️ **Include Seasonal Info**

> Use Scratch to show when foods are in season — maybe a “what’s growing now” calendar with clickable items.

🧾 **Add a Receipt Generator**

> Show a pretend receipt at the end of a quiz or game showing what the player ‘bought’, the food miles they saved, and a score!

🎶 **Add Fun Sounds or Music**

> Record your own eco-soundtrack or voiceovers explaining how to eat locally — or just add silly sound effects when foods are clicked!

📍 **Use a Map Backdrop**

> Add a world map or a UK map and animate where foods come from using Scratch’s motion blocks and costumes.

🔄 **Create a Random Recipe Generator**

> Make a Scratch project that spins through local ingredients and creates a fun recipe suggestion each time you click!

📦 **Customise With Real World Research**

> Find out which foods are grown locally near _you_ and include them in your project — make it truly local and relevant!

### 🎯 Why it matters

The world needs people like YOU to care about the planet. You’re not just learning to code — you’re using computing to make a difference.
