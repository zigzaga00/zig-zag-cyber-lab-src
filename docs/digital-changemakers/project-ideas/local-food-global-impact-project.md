## 🌀💖 **Project Idea Card: Local Food, Global Impact**

### 🧠 **Project Prompt**

Can you create a **digital tool** that helps people understand how far their food travels — and gives ideas for more sustainable, local alternatives?

---

### 🛠️ **What You Might Make**

- A simple **Python app** that asks where your food comes from and estimates **food miles**.
- A **data visualisation** project using charts or maps to show the impact of different food choices.
- A **local food suggestion generator** (e.g. “Instead of bananas from Ecuador, try apples from Kent!”).
- A **mini website** with facts and numbers to raise awareness.

---

### 💡 **You Could Include**

- A database or list of foods and where they’re commonly grown.
- Python to calculate distances or estimate carbon footprints.
- Micro:bit sensors to monitor temperature or plant growth if you try growing something yourself!
- Ideas from real-world campaigns (e.g. #eatlocal or zero-mile food movements).

### 🔁 Twists and Tweaks

- Make a **local food calculator** that gives a “score” for each meal based on its impact.
- Add a **quiz** to test others on their food choices.
- Link with a real-world challenge: can you and your family lower your food miles this week?

---

### 🌈 Bonus Ideas

- Use Scratch or PowerPoint to make an interactive version if you’re not using Python yet.

---

### 🌟 Extension Ideas

> Ready to go further? Try these next steps:

- **Use real-world data** from a public dataset (e.g. UK food imports) to add accuracy.
- **Build a simple website** using HTML/CSS to present your tool to others.
- **Connect your project to real action**: Can your school garden grow something local?

---

### 🐣 Simplify It

> Want to get started with a simpler version?

- Start by choosing **just one or two foods** to compare.
- Use a **list of foods** and match each to a place (e.g. Bananas → Ecuador).
- Instead of using distance, just show a simple **emoji code** like 🌍 = far, 🏡 = local.
- Create a **poster-style output** in Scratch or PowerPoint with clickable food images.
- Write a **story or quiz** in Scratch that teaches others about food miles.
