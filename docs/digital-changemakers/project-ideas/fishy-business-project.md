## 🌀💖 **Project Idea: Fishy Business!**

> _Ready to explore the state of our seas? Let data help you understand more about our wonderful fishy friends!_

---

### 🚀 **What’s the project?**

Explore how different countries are doing in conserving (looking after) fish species! Use a [dataset](#download-the-csv-file-click-the-picture) that includes:

- Total fish species
- Number of threatened species (almost gone forever)
- Country GDP (how rich countries are)

Can you find out anything interesting or useful? Can you use the data to answer questions you may have? Can you use your discoveries to try to help fish?

### 🎯 **What Will I Learn?**

- How to read and understand CSV data
- Calculate percentages (e.g., % of species threatened)
- Make bar graphs to show your findings
- Use Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) or Excel or 2Graph to spot patterns
- Turn your findings into an informative webpage

### ✨ **Make it Yours**

Make this project unique - how about these ideas?

- Focus on countries in a specific continent
- Research data for different countries which are of interest to you
- Add a map showing where the countries are
- Include animal facts or fun fish trivia in your presentation or webpage
- Create a game based on what you discover or the data itself
- Program a simple chatbot to answer questions based on the data and your findings
- Program a chatbot using AI
- Write an email to somebody who could help make things better

---

### 🧮 **Simplify It!**

- Use 2Graph in PurpleMash to plot your findings
- Use Excel or a simple calculator to work out percentages
- Work with just 3 countries
- Use PowerPoint or Sway to present your findings

---

### 🚀 **Extension Challenge!**

- Create a website to showcase your findings and ideas
- Compare fish data with other animals (e.g., threatened mammals or birds)
- Research a country doing really well or badly and find out why this is the case

---

### 🧺 **You'll Need**

- Your [fish dataset](#download-the-csv-file-click-the-picture)
- A computer with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Excel or...
- ...a computer with Excel and PurpleMash for 2Graph
- Curiosity!
