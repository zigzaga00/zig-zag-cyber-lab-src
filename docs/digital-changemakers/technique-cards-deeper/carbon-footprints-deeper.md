## 🟦🌍 **Technique Card: Understanding Carbon Footprints (deeper)**

---

### 🦶 **What is a Carbon Footprint?**

Your **carbon footprint** is the **total amount of greenhouse gases** (like carbon dioxide and methane) that are released into the air **because of your actions**.

It’s measured in **kilograms (kg) or tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e)** — which means all gases are turned into the same unit to make things easier to compare.

---

### 🧮 **How Is It Calculated?**

Think of your carbon footprint like a **big total made from many smaller parts**.

Here are **some of the main areas** that add up:

| Activity      | What’s Measured              | Example                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 🚗 Transport  | Fuel used & distance         | Driving to school, flying on holiday |
| ⚡ Energy Use | Electricity & heating        | Turning lights on, hot showers       |
| 🍔 Food       | How it’s grown & transported | Eating meat vs vegetables            |
| 🛍️ Shopping   | Materials & delivery         | Buying clothes, toys, phones         |
| 🗑️ Waste      | What gets thrown away        | Plastic, food waste, recycling       |

These are **added together** using average values or actual data (if available), to give a **total footprint**.

### 💡 **A Simple Example**

Let’s say:

- You drive 5km to school every day
- You eat mostly local fruit and veg
- You buy a new pair of trainers every 6 months

A carbon footprint calculator could use **average emissions** from each activity to give you an estimate, like:

- 🚗 Driving: 500kg CO₂e/year
- 🍎 Food: 200kg CO₂e/year
- 👟 Shopping: 150kg CO₂e/year

➡️ **Total: 850kg CO₂e/year**

---

### 🔍 **Why Is It Useful?**

Knowing your carbon footprint helps you:

- Understand **how your choices affect the planet**
- Find **ways to reduce** your impact
- Compare the impact of **different lifestyles or products**

This is super helpful for:

- **Campaigns**
- **Data projects**
- **Making change happen**

---

### 🛠️ **Common Tools**

You can use:

- **Online calculators** (e.g. WWF, Giki Zero, CoolClimate)
- **Surveys and spreadsheets** to collect and compare data
- **Scratch or Python projects** to **create your own carbon trackers**

---

### 🌱 **Ideas for Digital Changemakers**

- Compare food miles of local vs imported meals
- Survey your school’s travel choices and total carbon output
- Make a Scratch game about reducing your home energy use
- Create your own carbon footprint calculator - it could use just one idea such as food eaten or distance travelled in different vehicles
