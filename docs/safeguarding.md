## **11. Online Privacy**

The Zig-Zag Cyber-Lab is committed to protecting children's privacy while they explore and create using technology.

- We do not collect or store children’s personal data unless it is necessary for safeguarding, communication, or consent purposes, and only with permission from parents or carers.
- Children will be supported to understand how to protect their own privacy online, including using safe usernames, not sharing personal information, and recognising when to ask for help.

## **12. Policy Review and Availability**

- This policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if needed.

---

## **13. A Safe and Supportive Environment**

The Zig-Zag Cyber-Lab safeguarding approach is not only about protection — it is about creating the kind of space where children can be happy and thrive by feeling confident, valued, and inspired to learn.

We will:

- **Foster an inclusive and respectful atmosphere** where every child feels welcome, validated and able to be themselves.
- **Encourage curiosity and creativity**, helping children take positive risks in their learning while knowing they are supported.
- **Celebrate achievements and effort**, both big and small, to help build self-esteem and confidence.
- **Listen to children's voices**, encouraging them to express themselves freely in a safe and accepting environment.
- **Model positive digital behaviour**, promoting kindness, fairness, and teamwork both on and offline.

We believe safeguarding is not just about keeping children safe — it is about giving them the freedom and confidence to be themselves, accept others as they are and develop self belief by experiencing success in a genuinely caring and supportive environment.
