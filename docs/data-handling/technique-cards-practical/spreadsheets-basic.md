### 🔧 Try It Out

Let’s say you’re looking at different **fish species and how many are left** in the oceans.

Here’s how your spreadsheet might look:

| A              | B            | C           |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1 Fish Species | Threat Level | Number Left |
| 2 Cod          | Medium       | 120000      |
| 3 Bluefin Tuna | High         | 5000        |
| 4 Haddock      | Low          | 300000      |
| 5              |              |             |
| 6 Total Fish   |              | =C2+C3+C4   |
| 7 % Tuna       |              | =C3/C6\*100 |

#### 💡 Step-by-Step:

1. **Enter your data** in cells A1 to C4.
2. In **cell C6**, type:

   ```
   =C2+C3+C4
   ```

   This adds all the fish left together.

3. In **cell C7**, type:
   ```
   =C3/C6*100
   ```
   This finds what percentage of all the fish are Bluefin Tuna.

### 🧪 Practise This

You can try this with your own data!

#### 🍎 Food Miles Example:

| A         | B       | C               |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1 Food    | Country | Miles Travelled |
| 2 Apples  | UK      | 100             |
| 3 Bananas | Ecuador | 5600            |
| 4 Oranges | Spain   | 900             |
| 5 Total   |         | =C2+C3+C4       |
| 6 % Local |         | =C2/C5\*100     |

Try changing the numbers to see how the totals and percentages change.

### 🔄 Sorting and Filtering

- **Sort** your table by clicking:  
  **Data → Sort range** → Sort by column C (Miles Travelled)

- **Filter** by clicking the filter icon and choosing just one country or threat level to view.

### 🌱 Why This Matters

Spreadsheets help you **make sense of the world** with numbers. They let you find out which foods travel furthest, which fish need help, and where you can make a difference!
