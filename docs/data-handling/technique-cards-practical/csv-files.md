## 🟨📊 **Technique Card: Working with CSV Files (practical)**

**Big Idea:** A **CSV file** is a way to store data in plain text — it stands for **Comma-Separated Values**.  
**Useful for:** Saving data from surveys or projects, using data in Scratch, Python, or spreadsheets.

---

### 🧠 What’s a CSV?

A CSV is just **a list of data stored in a text file**, where each **line** is a row and each **comma** separates columns.

Here’s what a simple CSV might look like:

```
Name,Travel Type
Alice,Walk
Ben,Bike
Cleo,Car
Dan,Walk
```

👆 Each row is like one row in a spreadsheet. The commas act like the **borders between columns**.

---

### ✅ Why Use CSV Files?

- ✅ They work with lots of programs (Excel, Scratch extensions, Python, Google Sheets)
- ✅ Easy to share and upload
- ✅ Super simple to create by hand or from a spreadsheet
- ✅ Great for storing **survey results**, **project data**, and **changing values in code**

### 🧪 How to Make a CSV File

#### ✍️ Method 1: With a Text Editor (like Notepad)

1. Open Notepad (or any plain text editor).
2. Type your data like this:

```
Food,Distance (km)
Apples,120
Bananas,6000
Carrots,50
```

3. Save it as:  
   **`food_miles.csv`**  
   🔁 Make sure it ends in `.csv`, and not `.txt`.

---

#### 📊 Method 2: With Excel (or Google Sheets)

1. Type your data into the spreadsheet like normal.
2. Go to **File → Save As** (or **Download**).
3. Choose **CSV (Comma delimited) (.csv)** as the file type.
4. Save!

📎 Now your data is in a plain text format that other programs can understand.

### 💡 Top Tips

- Don’t use commas inside your data unless you really have to (it can confuse the file!)
- Always check the first line – it’s the **header** and tells what each column means.
- You can open CSV files in **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **Python**, and some Scratch extensions (like the Data Importer).

### 🔍 Try This!

Make a CSV with:

```
Name,How they get to school
Max,Walk
Tia,Bus
Alex,Bike
```

Open it in a spreadsheet and see the data appear in separate columns!  
Then try changing the file in the text editor and reloading it.
