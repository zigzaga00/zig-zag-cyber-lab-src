## 🟨📊 **Technique Card: Creating Graphs with 2Graph (practical)**

**Big Idea:** Graphs help us **see patterns** in data. With 2Graph on Purple Mash, you can easily turn your survey or project data into colourful, clear charts.  
**Useful for:** Showing food mile distances, favourite foods, travel surveys, and more!

### 🧠 What is 2Graph?

**2Graph** is a simple tool on Purple Mash that lets you:

- Type in your data
- Choose a type of graph (bar, scatter, line, etc.)
- Label your graph and share or print it

### 🧪 Step-by-Step: Make a Graph in 2Graph

1. **Log in** to [Purple Mash](https://www.purplemash.com) with your school account.

2. Go to the **Tools** tab.

3. Find and click on **2Graph** (under **Maths** or **Data Handling**).

4. You’ll see two columns:
   - **Label** (what each bar or part represents)
   - **Value** (the number for each item)

---

### 📝 Example: How Children Travel to School

| Label | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Walk  | 72    |
| Bike  | 38    |
| Car   | 56    |
| Bus   | 44    |

👣 Type each **travel type** into the **Label** column and the **number of children** in the **Value** column.

### 🎨 Choose Your Graph Type

At the top, click one of the graph icons to switch between:

- **Bar chart** (great for comparing)
- **Scatter graph** (great for showing connections)
- **Line graph** (good for changes over time)

---

### 🧷 Add a Title and Labels

1. Click the **Title** box and type a clear title, like:  
   _“How Our Class Gets to School”_

2. You can also add **x-axis** and **y-axis** labels if using a bar or line graph.

### 💾 Save or Share

- Click the **Purple Disk icon** to save your graph in your folder.
- Or use the **Export icon** to export your graph as a **CSV file** or a **PNG image** file.
