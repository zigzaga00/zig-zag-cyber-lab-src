## 🟦📊 **Technique Card: Understanding Percentages (deeper)**

**Big Idea:** A percentage is a _part out of 100_. It helps us fairly compare data — especially when group sizes are different.  
**Useful for:** Surveys, school projects, spreadsheets, and digital changemaker work.

---

### 🧠 What Is a Percentage?

A **percentage** tells you _how many out of 100_.

- 32% means **32 children out of every 100**
- 100% means **everyone**
- 50% means **a half**
- 25% means **one quarter**
- 0% means **nobody**

It helps us understand how big a part is — even when totals are different.

### 🚌 Survey Example: How Children Get to School

At a school of **210 students**, a survey showed:

| Travel Type | Number of Students |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| Walk        | 84                 |
| Bike        | 21                 |
| Car         | 63                 |
| Bus         | 42                 |
| **Total**   | 210                |

Let’s work out the percentage who **walk to school**.

### 👉 Step-by-Step:

1. Divide the part by the total:  
   `84 ÷ 210 = 0.4`

2. Multiply by 100:  
   `0.4 × 100 = 40%`

✅ So **40% of children walk to school**.

### 🔍 Why Percentages Matter

Percentages help you:

- Compare different groups fairly
- Understand _how big_ or _small_ a part is
- Spot important patterns or problems
- Show change (like how much CO₂ has gone up or down)

---

### 💡 Why Use Percentages?

Percentages let us **compare** schools fairly.

Say another school has **525 students**, and 210 of them walk.

- That’s `210 ÷ 525 = 0.4`
- `0.4 × 100 = 40%`

Even though one school has more children walking, both have **40%** — so the walking rate is the _same_.

📊 Percentages give a **fair picture**.

### 🧮 Quick Formula

```
Percentage = (Part ÷ Total) × 100
```

Use this when:

- Comparing data from different schools or places
- Showing results from a class or school survey
- Making graphs or explaining trends

Do you:

- Want to know what percentage of fish are endangered?
- Or what percentage of your food is local?
- Or how much a number has increased or decreased?

**Use the formula every time!**

---

### 🧠 Extra: What Does 32% Really Mean?

If 32% of children come by car:

- In a school of 100 → **32 children**
- In a school of 210 → `32 ÷ 100 × 210 = 67.2` → **about 67 children**
- In a school of 525 → `32 ÷ 100 × 525 = 168` → **168 children**

You can also **reverse it** to find percentages from numbers.

---

### 🧠 Even Extra! Increase and Decrease by Percent

Want to know how much something has **changed**?

Say fish population went from 2000 to 1600.

1. Find the **change**:  
   `2000 - 1600 = 400`

2. Divide the change by the original:  
   `400 ÷ 2000 = 0.2`

3. Multiply by 100:  
   `0.2 × 100 = 20% decrease`

📉 The fish population went **down by 20%** ☹️

### 🎯 When You Might Use This

- **Creating infographics** for digital changemaker campaigns
- **Surveys** about travel, food, energy use
- **Comparing** school data across sizes
- **Scratch games** with chance (e.g. 25% chance to win!)
- **Making spreadsheets** more useful and visual
- **Digital changemakers** exploring data to help the world
- **Graphs and infographics** to explain your ideas
- **Budgets** and **surveys** — how many people agree?
