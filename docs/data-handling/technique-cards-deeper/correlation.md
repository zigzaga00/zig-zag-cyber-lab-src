## 🟦📊 **Technique Card: Understanding Correlation (deeper)**

### 💡 What Is Correlation?

**Correlation** is when two things seem to change in a connected way.

- If one thing changes, and another changes **with it**, we say there is a **correlation**.
- It helps us **spot patterns** and ask smart questions like:  
  ➤ _"Do people who revise more score higher?"_  
  ➤ _"Does screen time affect sleep?"_

### 🔄 The Three Types of Correlation

| Type                        | What Happens                                                                      | Easy Example                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Positive Correlation** | When one thing goes **up**, the other goes **up** too (or both go down together). | More hours revising = Higher test scores |
| ❌ **Negative Correlation** | When one thing goes **up**, the other goes **down**.                              | More time watching TV = Less sleep       |
| ❓ **No Correlation**       | The two things don’t change together in any clear way.                            | Shoe size vs test scores                 |

### 📊 Why Is This Useful?

- 🔍 **Helps us spot patterns** in data — like "Which habits help learning?"
- 🧠 **Makes us curious** to explore relationships between things.
- 🗣️ **Gives us something to say** in a report or presentation:  
  _"Our data shows a strong positive correlation between exercise and concentration!"_

> ❗ But remember: **Correlation is not causation.**  
> Just because two things go together doesn’t mean one causes the other!

### ⚠️ Correlation Is Not the Same as Causation!

Just because two things change together (correlation), that **doesn't mean one causes the other** (causation).

#### 🧩 Here's the Difference:

| Term            | What It Means                        | Example                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correlation** | Two things move together             | Children who wear bigger shoes tend to have better handwriting. |
| **Causation**   | One thing directly affects the other | Practising handwriting improves neatness.                       |

The shoe-handwriting example is **correlation** — but not causation. Older children have bigger feet **and** neater handwriting because they’re older — **age causes both**, but the shoe size isn’t the reason their writing improves!

---

### 🧠 A Good Way to Think About It

> **Correlation is like spotting a pattern.**  
> **Causation is knowing the reason behind it.**

Just seeing a link isn’t enough. We need to **think deeper**:

- Could something else be causing both?
- Is it just a coincidence?
- Can we test it?

---

### 🕵️ Why This Matters

If we **mistake correlation for causation**, we might:

- Make bad decisions
- Spread false ideas
- Miss what’s really going on

So always ask:  
**"Does this cause that?" Or are they just happening together?"**

---

### 🛠 Where You'll Use This

- In **science**: “Does watering plants more often help them grow faster?”
- In **geography**: “Do countries with more forests have cleaner air?”
- In **school projects**: “Do children who eat breakfast perform better on tests?”
- In **digital changemaker work**: exploring data to spot social or environmental issues.

### 🧪 Try It Out!

Using a scatter graph:

- Plot the data
- Look at the dots:  
  ➤ Do they go _up together_ (↗)?  
  ➤ Does one go up as the other goes _down_ (↘)?  
  ➤ Or are they scattered randomly (• • •)?

Then decide:  
**Positive? Negative? Or No Correlation?**
