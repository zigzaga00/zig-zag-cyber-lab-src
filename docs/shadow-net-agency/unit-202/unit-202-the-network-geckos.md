## ShadowNet Cyber Spy Academy

### 🧠 Welcome, Operative!

Welcome to **Unit 202 – The Network Geckos**, where your training in **offensive network operations** begins.
You’re about to enter a world of secret nodes, hidden subnets, encrypted messages, and forgotten systems.

Your mission?
**Infiltrate. Investigate. Exploit. And Report.**
All while staying undetected in the shadows.

> 🦎 Just like the gecko—silent, agile, and deadly in the dark—you’ll learn to move through networks without a trace.

### 🕵️‍♀️ What Do the Network Geckos Do?

Network Geckos are elite agents of the ShadowNet Agency trained in:

- 🔍 **Scanning** networks to reveal hidden systems and services
- 🧭 **Mapping** internal topologies
- 🛠️ **Exploiting** known vulnerabilities in services like SSH, FTP, SMB, and more
- 🧪 **Escalating privileges** to gain full system control
- 🐚 **Dropping shells**—both reverse and bind—to open backdoors
- 🦠 **Uncovering new internal networks** - seeing how deep the rabbit hole goes

You are not a defender.
You are a **red operative**, striking first to uncover threats before they strike us.
