## 🦎 Unit 202: The Network Geckos

### 🟣 Shadow Recruit Level

### 🖥️ Mission 001: **The Forgotten Terminal**

---

### 🧠 **Briefing**

ShadowNet’s internal sensors have detected a _power surge and network activity_ from a long-decommissioned terminal inside **Echo-Sector**—a hidden, classified subnet last used during the **[Blackout-Protocol Incident](./blackout-protocol-incident.md)**

The system is known only as:
**`node17.echo.local`**

There has been **no authorised access** to this machine in many years. And yet... it’s now online.

Your mission as a Shadow Recruit is to:

- Locate the terminal on the Echo-Sector network.
- Identify the service that’s allowing remote access.
- Break into the system using discovered or known credentials.

### 📡 **Mission Intel**

This machine:

- Exists on your network.
- Has **no hostname in DNS**—you will be given its IP directly.
- Appears to be running a **service on a known port**.

Our training records suggest the system may still respond to **old ShadowNet credentials**. If so, the Obsidian Circuit may have already exploited this weakness…

### 📋 **Your Objectives**

- ✅ Scan the target system’s IP to identify open ports and determine the service available
- ✅ Use an exposed service to attempt access to the terminal of NODE17
- ✅ If successful, find and report back the **codeword** being used by the mysterious user **obs-c1rCu1t**

**🪖 Your task: Record the codeword. That’s your flag.**

### 🔒 **Note from HQ**

This system is legacy. That means it is **old** with **weak security**. But be warned: whoever reactivated this terminal is **likely to be watching...**
