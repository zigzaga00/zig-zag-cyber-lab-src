# ✉️ Mission 002 – The Anonymous Courier

**Unit 202: The Network Geckos – Shadow Recruit Level**  
**Mission Type:** Reconnaissance & Data Extraction

---

## 🧭 Mission Brief

An unexpected signal spike has been traced to a forgotten node deep inside the **Echo-Sector** subnet. The node appears to be hosting a **public file drop point**. This type of activity is highly irregular — and possibly dangerous.

Your mission is to hack onto the strange file server machine and uncover any sensitive material. The information being stored there may reveal more about **obs-c1rCu1t** and what they are doing with the echo sector.

---

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

- Investigate the target system and identify the type of services running
- Attempt to gain access using any known methods
- Search for a file stored within the system which relates to **obs-c1rCu1t** | your **flag** will be found in the file
- Search the machine for any **usernames** of **sna-agents** involved in **old SNA operations** - we believe they are being used by **obs-c1rCu1t**
- Submit **three usernames** linked to past SNA operations

---

## 🧩 Field Notes

This mission will test your ability to probe exposed systems without triggering alarms. Some doors don’t need keys — just the knowledge that they’re unlocked.

What you find here may connect to something much larger. Watch for patterns. Follow the data trails. Take nothing at face value.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You will be considered successful when:

- You submit the flag
- You submit three usernames of SNA agents linked to past operations

## 🧠 Shadow Hint

Use your training from **Unit 101** once on the mysterious file server.
Remember, **passwords** and **code words** are **often reused** so it is **always wise to try them in different places**.
