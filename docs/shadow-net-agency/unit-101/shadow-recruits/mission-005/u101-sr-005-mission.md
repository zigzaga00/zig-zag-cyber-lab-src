# 🎯 Mission 005: The Execution Key

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Mission 005**
**🔍 Objective:** Locate a file with suspicious **execute permissions** for a non-standard group. Uncover the identity of the agent with access via that group.

---

#### 🖥️ **Mission Briefing**

> “ShadowNet surveillance scripts have detected a **file being executed without logging**. We suspect it is being used for rogue agentY’s operations.
>
> Initial scans show that the file **is not directly owned by you**, yet it **allows execution for a specific group**. We believe this group was **created to mask movement and conceal access**.
>
> The execution rights granted are no accident — they form a **digital handshake between agentY and a shadowy accomplice**.

---

#### 🧪 **Your Mission**

Your task is to:

1. **Locate the file** with an unusual permission setup:

   - Owned by **agentY**
   - Group has **execute-only (x)** access

2. Determine **which group** has been granted this permission.

3. **Uncover the name** of the user in that group who is _not agentY_.

4. Report this **malicious account** to HQ as your **flag**.

#### 🛰️ Intel Hints

- The file is **not in your home directory**.
- The group name may appear **innocuous or system-like**.
- Only those in the group can **execute** it — ask yourself why.
- Your **existing ShadowNet technique cards** may hold the tools you need.

---

#### 🎯 Success Criteria

To complete this mission and earn your **Execution Key Badge**, report back:

- 📁 **The name of the file**
- 🧑‍💻 **The group with x permissions**
- 🕵️ **The other user in that group**

!!! important
You need to **remove execution permissions completely** from the suspicious file!

**⚠️ Proceed with caution. The accomplice may be more than a name in a file.**
