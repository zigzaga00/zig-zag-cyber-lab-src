# 🎯 Mission 002: The Whispering Files

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Mission 002**

---

## 🕵️ Mission Brief

**CODE RED:** A rogue ShadowNet agent has planted a hidden file somewhere in our system. Intel suggests it contains a **stolen password**—the kind of data that could **compromise our entire network!**

This file is **invisible to ordinary eyes**, but not to trained recruits like you.

Your mission is to:

1. **Locate the hidden file**.
2. **Reveal its contents**.
3. **Decode the stolen data**.
4. **Report back with the stolen password** — this is your **flag** to prove mission success.

## 🧭 Intel from HQ

We have tracked unusual activity to a directory on our system — **it is not in your home directory**. The rogue agent has stashed the file where most wouldn’t look.

Here’s what we know:

- The file is **hidden**.
- It’s likely inside a **suspiciously named directory**.
- The contents are probably **scrambled** somehow to prevent easy reading.
