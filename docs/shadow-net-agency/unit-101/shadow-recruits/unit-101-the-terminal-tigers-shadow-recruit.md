# 🐯 Unit 101: Terminal Tigers

### _Linux Command Line Operations – Shadow Recruit Tier_

---

> **Shadow Net Agency Internal Briefing** > **Clearance Level:** RECRUIT
> **Division:** Terminal Tigers
> **Mission Type:** Covert Command-Line Operations

---

### 🕵️ Welcome, Recruit...

You've just stepped into the underground command cell of the **Terminal Tigers** — Shadow Net’s elite operatives who live in the **shadows of the Linux terminal**. They operate without GUI, without noise, and without hesitation. Every command typed is a move in the digital chessboard of espionage.

You are here because you’ve shown potential. The ability to think clearly, problem-solve under pressure, and remain unseen. Now it's time to train.

---

## 🥷🏼 What Do the Terminal Tigers Specialise In?

The Terminal Tigers are masters of the **Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)** — the core language of the machine. GUI tools are for the public. The terminal is for those who **demand control**.

In this unit, you will:

- Navigate complex file systems silently and efficiently.
- Hunt for hidden data and buried messages.
- Discover how to inspect, manipulate, and defend files and directories.
- Learn how to operate in stealth, using the most powerful tool in cybersecurity: the **terminal.**

Why does this matter? Because **every real system we hack** — from servers to routers to cybersecurity defenses — speaks the language of the terminal. And if you can master that language, **you can do anything.**
