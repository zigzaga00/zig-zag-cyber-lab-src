# 🎯 Mission 003: Uncover the Ghost File

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Mission 003**

---

## 🧠 Mission Briefing

**ShadowNet Intel Drop – TOP SECRET**

A rogue agent has hidden a stolen **security door passcode** somewhere deep within our system. The file is not only hidden — it’s buried within a hidden **directory** known to use stealth naming tactics.

We need Terminal Tiger Shadow Recruits like you to **locate the hidden file**, identify the secret **directory it lives in**, and retrieve the **flag** (the passcode) inside.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use your training to **search the entire system**.
- Track down the **hidden file** that contains the **passcode**.
- Report **both**:
  - ✅ The name of the **hidden directory** (it might help us identify the rogue agent).
  - ✅ The **flag** (the actual **stolen door passcode**).

---

## 🧩 Intelligence Clues

- The file is hidden **somewhere on the system**, inside a **hidden directory**
- The directory is sneaky...
- ...standard methods won’t work. You’ll need an **advanced file search technique**.

## 📦 Outcome

Once you've:

- Located the **hidden file**
- Discovered the **directory name** (with a possible name for the rogue agent)
- Unlocked the **flag** (the passcode)

🧾 Present your findings to your Terminal Tiger trainer.  
Only then will your mission be marked as complete, and your progress recorded in the ShadowNet logs.

## 🕶️ ShadowNet Reminder

Every file leaves a trace.  
Even the ghosts.

Find it. Prove it. Report it.  
Good luck, Recruit.
