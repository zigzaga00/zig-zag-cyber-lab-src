# 🎯 Mission 001: Navigating the Shadows

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Mission 001**

---

## 📡 Incoming Transmission from ShadowNet HQ...

> **Recruit, your journey into the terminal shadows begins.**  
> A suspicious file has surfaced somewhere in our system.  
> We suspect it has been dropped by a rogue agent.  
> Your job is to **navigate the file system**, locate this file, and report its **name** back to HQ.

## 🗺️ Mission Intel

You’ve been deployed to your home base:

```
/home/sr-101
```

The file is somewhere **beyond your current position** — deep within the network of folders. Use your terminal skills to explore, investigate, and **find the location** where the rogue agent stashed it.

⚠️ The file is **not hidden**, but it is not in your starting directory.

## 🧰 Operational Support

You may access the following resource:

- 🛠️ **[Training Card: Navigating Linux | SR 101](./u101-sr-001-training.md)**

Use the tools outlined there to:

## 🎖️ Mission Objective

✅ **Find the file.**  
✅ **Record its filename.**  
✅ **Report the filename to HQ (your instructor).**

🕶️ The file’s name relates to the tigers. You’ll know it when you see it.
