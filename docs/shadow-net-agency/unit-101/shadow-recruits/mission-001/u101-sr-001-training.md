# 🕶️ Technique Card: Navigating Linux

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Recruit Training File – Classified Level 1**

---

## 🎯 Mission Brief

Before you can complete missions and field operations, you must learn to **move silently through the file system**. Use these essential terminal commands to explore, locate targets, and escape unnoticed.

Your first mission (_Navigating the Shadows_) requires locating a secret file hidden deep in the digital jungle.

## 🔍 Terminal Tools of the Shadow Recruit

### 🧭 `pwd` — Print Working Directory

> 📌 _“Know your location. A lost agent is a compromised agent.”_

Use `pwd` to discover where you currently are in the file system.

```bash
pwd
```

🔎 Example Output:

```
/home/sr-101/Documents/Missions
```

---

### 🛤️ `cd` — Change Directory

> 📌 _“The quietest path is the one only you know.”_

Use `cd` (change directory) to move between folders. Think of it as walking through a network of hidden corridors.

```bash
cd foldername
```

To go **up one level**:

```bash
cd ..
```

To go **back to your home base**:

```bash
cd ~
```

🔎 Example:

```bash
cd secrets/level1
```

---

### 🧾 `ls` — List Contents

> 📌 _“Observe before you act. The shadows hide many things.”_

Use `ls` to view the contents of your current folder.

```bash
ls
```

For **more details** (like types, sizes, dates), try:

```bash
ls -l
```

## 🧠 Operative Intel

🔸 **Tip 1**: If you get lost, run `pwd` to reorient yourself.  
🔸 **Tip 2**: Use `ls` before and after every `cd` to keep your senses sharp.  
🔸 **Tip 3**: Folders are like locked rooms — `cd` is your key.

## 🧪 ShadowNet Training Task

Practice your stealth:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Use `pwd` to find your location.
3. Use `ls` to look around.
4. Use `cd` to enter the correct directories.
5. Try to locate the file: `secret-shadow.txt`.

> 🐾 **Remember, Tiger:**  
> Real power lies not in force, but in **precision**.  
> Master the shadows. Move like smoke. Strike like light.
