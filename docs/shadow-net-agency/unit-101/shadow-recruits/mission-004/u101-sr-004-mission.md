# 🎯 Mission 004: Who has the Power?

### Unit 101 – Terminal Tigers 🐯 | Rank: Shadow Recruit

**ShadowNet Agency: Mission 004**

---

### 🔒 Classification: Restricted

### 🐾 Operative Level: Shadow Recruit

### 📁 Mission Briefing

ShadowNet has detected irregular activity on the internal comms grid. An **unauthorised signal** is set to be transmitted from within the agency, containing sensitive operational data. The time of this transmission is the **flag** you must uncover.

We don’t know who’s behind it. We don’t know where the message is hidden. But we believe it’s coming from **a user with elevated system powers**.

This is no ordinary file drop, Recruit. The message has been **obscured** — hidden somewhere deep and protected. We believe it is encoded and concealed to avoid detection.

You must infiltrate the system and uncover:

- **Who has the power?**
- **What secrets are they hiding?**
- **When will the signal be sent?**

---

### 🎯 Objectives

1. Investigate the system to determine **which users have elevated privileges**.
2. Explore the file system carefully. Use your wits and tools.
3. Seek out any signs of **hidden or suspicious files**.
4. We believe the file you are looking for contains the word **compromised** in its name.
5. Decode any suspicious file or message you discover.

### 🕸️ ShadowNet Intel Drop

- The key to finding the file lies in identifying **who has the power** on the system.
