## 🕶️ Welcome to the Tiger Den

You've just stepped into the most disciplined, silent, and deadly unit in the Shadow Net Agency.

**The Terminal Tigers** are masters of stealth and command-line control. They operate beneath the surface of every system — where others click, they type; where others look, they find. From deep reconnaissance to forensic analysis, they leave no trail and fear no prompt.

---

## ❔ What Do the Terminal Tigers Do?

Terminal Tigers specialise in:

- Navigating Linux-based systems via the terminal
- Locating and manipulating files and directories
- Investigating suspicious activity on secure machines
- Understanding users, groups, permissions, and process control
- Writing scripts to automate tasks and control environments

Their tools? Precision. Patience. And a blinking cursor.

Every Terminal Tiger must master the **language of Linux**, because it’s the foundation of most servers, firewalls, and digital infrastructure around the world. When a mission calls for raw access, quiet intrusion, or command-level control — the Tigers are deployed.

## 🪖 Training Structure

The Terminal Tigers training is split into four progressive ranks. Each rank contains **missions** — some focused training operations and one **final deployment** where you must put all your skills to the test.

Earn a **certificate** at each rank. Complete all four ranks and you will be awarded the prestigious **Terminal Tiger Insignia** — a mark of elite command-line skill.
