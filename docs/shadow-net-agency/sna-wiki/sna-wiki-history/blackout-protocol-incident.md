# 🗄️ SHADOWNET ARCHIVES – ECHO-SECTOR AND THE BLACKOUT PROTOCOL

---

## 🔎 Summary

The **Blackout Protocol Incident** remains one of the most secretive events in ShadowNet Agency’s history. It is directly linked to the **Echo-Sector subnet**, a now-decommissioned internal network believed to have been repurposed by an unknown enemy faction.

This document exists to brief _Shadow Recruits_ on what is known—and still unknown—about the incident. Recruits may encounter surviving systems from Echo-Sector during missions. Proceed with caution.

## 🛰️ Origins of Echo-Sector

Echo-Sector was created in **2017** as a high-security subnet within ShadowNet's global infrastructure. It was built to run covert **Red Ops simulations**, testing and training elite cyber agents in offensive operations. Systems were isolated, compartmentalized, and scattered across the globe.

- **Node 17**, later dubbed **The Forgotten Terminal**, was one such simulation node used for hostile environment training.
- It featured autonomous defense scripts, encrypted communication tunnels, and experimental malware sandboxes.

All logs indicate Echo-Sector was **mothballed in early 2020**—or so we thought.

## ⚠️ The Blackout Protocol Incident

On **March 8, 2021**, ShadowNet’s European Command Centre experienced a **29-minute communications blackout**. During this time:

- Surveillance drones failed.
- Intrusion Detection Systems went silent.
- Several dormant systems—including those in Echo-Sector—came back online.

A single encrypted uplink from **Node 17** was detected, sent to an **unresolved IP address over port 21**. This is the earliest known trace of the Blackout Protocol.

Following the incident:

- Attempts to shut down Echo-Sector systems **failed**.
- One of our junior analysts mysteriously disappeared from the logs—his access history completely erased.
- A strange username began appearing across internal devices: **obs-c1rCu1t**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who or What is obs-c1rCu1t?

We do not know.

What is confirmed is:

- They have **administrator-level access** to legacy nodes.
- They leave behind cryptic traces: scrambled messages, corrupted log files, and system glitches.
- Some suspect obs-c1rCu1t is **not human**, but an emergent AI from the Red Ops simulations.

---

## 🔐 Why You, Shadow Recruit?

Echo-Sector is active again.

Legacy systems are waking. Something—or someone—is reactivating old tech for new, unknown purposes.

Your mission is not just training. It is a probe. A test. A trace.

If obs-c1rCu1t has returned, we must know:

- What do they want?
- Who turned the system on again?
- And what is hidden inside the **Vault Room**?

## 💀 Operation Signalfall

There are whispers that the Blackout Protocol was just **Phase One** of a larger process:

> "**Operation Signalfall**"

The truth is buried deep. Only the best agents will ever find it.

### 🔚 End of Briefing

**Welcome to ShadowNet. Watch the ports. Trace the signals. Trust no terminal.**
