## 🟩🐱 **Feature Card: Random Movement**

**Type:** Feature
**Useful for:** Creating lifelike fish, monsters, random movement, and surprises in Scratch projects

---

### 🧠 What Is It?

Random movement makes your sprite behave **unexpectedly or differently each time**. It adds life to fish in a tank, wandering monsters, or floating space junk. You can make sprites move to **random places**, in **random directions**, or at **random speeds**.

---

### 🧪 You Could Try…

#### 🔹 **Jump to Random Positions**

Use this for teleporting, bubbles popping, or blinking stars:

---

#### 🔹 **Glide to Random Places Smoothly**

Use this to make a fish or ghost glide across the screen:

---

#### 🔹 **Move in Random Directions**

Use this to simulate wandering or swimming:

---

#### 🔹 **Change Speed Randomly**

Change the number of steps the sprite moves each time:

### 💡 Combine With

- 🎲 `pick random` (from **Operators**)
- 🔁 Loops (from **Control**)
- 🌊 `glide`, `move`, `go to` (from **Motion**)

---

### 🛠️ Challenges

- Make a sprite glide around like a fish in a tank.
- Create bubbles that pop at random spots.
- Make a monster spawn at a random location every few seconds.
- Add random speed or direction to keep things unpredictable.
- Use random movement + timers to create **“catch the sprite”** style games.
