## 🟨🐱 **Technique Card: Understanding Coordinates in Scratch**

How to use **coordinates** in **Scratch**!

### ✨ What Are Coordinates?

Scratch uses a **2D grid system** to position sprites on the stage.
Each place on the stage has an **(x, y)** coordinate:

| Axis | Direction    | Values go from | Example                      |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| x    | Left ↔ Right | -240 to 240    | `x = -100` is left of centre |
| y    | Down ↕ Up    | -180 to 180    | `y = 150` is near the top    |

The centre of the stage is at **(0, 0)** – right in the middle.

### 🧪 Try It!

Click on a sprite, then:

- Use the `go to x: ___ y: ___` block (from **Motion** category)
- Try different values and watch the sprite jump to those spots
- Try `glide 1 secs to x: ___ y: ___` for smooth movement

---

### 🎓 Top Tips

- Use **positive x** values to move right, **negative x** to move left
- Use **positive y** to move up, **negative y** to move down
- Use the **Xy-grid backdrop** (in the Backdrops library) to help visualise the coordinate system

---

### 💡 Handy Blocks

- `go to x: 0 y: 0` – sends sprite to centre
- `glide 1 secs to x: 100 y: -100` – smooth glide
- `set x to 150` / `set y to -80` – move only in one direction

---

### 🛠️ Challenges

1. Make a sprite jump to the corners of the stage using `go to x: y:` blocks
2. Make a sprite glide in a square using `glide` and different coordinates
3. Combine with `when green flag clicked` to set starting position
