### **HTML Basics (practical)**

Learn how to build your very first web page using simple but powerful HTML tags.

---

### 🚀 What you’ll learn

- How to write HTML to create a basic web page

### 🛠 Try this example

Open a text editor like Notepad (or a development environment like VSCode), and save your file as `index.html`.

Paste in this code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>I made this web page myself using HTML.</p>
    <a href="https://google.com">Visit a search engine!</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

🖱 Save it and double-click the file to open in a browser!

---

### 🧩 What’s going on?

| Tag          | What it does                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `<!DOCTYPE>` | Tells the browser this is HTML      |
| `<html>`     | The whole page starts and ends here |
| `<head>`     | Hidden info like page title         |
| `<body>`     | The part you _see_ in the browser   |
| `<h1>`       | Big heading                         |
| `<p>`        | A paragraph                         |
| `<a>`        | A link you can click                |

---

### 🧪 Try it yourself!

Change these bits and see what happens:

- Change the `<h1>` text to your name
- Add a second paragraph using `<p>Another paragraph!</p>`
- Add a second link to a site you like
