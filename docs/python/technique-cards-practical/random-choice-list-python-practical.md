## 🟨🐍 **Technique Card: Getting a Random Choice from a List in Python (practical)**

### 🚀 What You’ll Learn

How to randomly pick an item from a list in Python — great for games, name pickers, and creative projects.

---

### 🧠 Key Ideas

- Lists hold multiple values.
- The `random` module helps Python make random choices.
- `random.choice()` picks one item from a list at random.

---

### 📝 Example Code

```python
import random  # bring in the random module

band_names = ["The Zappers", "Neon Noodles", "Pixel Crunch", "Echo Shadows"]
random_name = random.choice(band_names)

print(f"Your band name is: {random_name}")
```

🧩 _You can change the list to anything you like — favourite foods, pet names, colours, spells…_

---

### 💡 Top Tips

- Don’t forget to use `import random` at the top of your code.
- Your list can include strings, numbers, or even other lists!
- This works with lists of any length — even just two options.

---

### 🔧 Try It Yourself

Change the list in the code to something fun, like:

```python
["Dragon", "Wizard", "Elf", "Goblin"]
```

Or mix things up with silly food combos:

```python
["Choco-pizza", "Cheese soup", "Banana tacos", "Ice cream stew"]
```

---

### 🧪 Experiment More

- Try running the code several times. What changes? Why?
- Add more items to the list.
- Can you use `random.choice()` to randomly choose something else in your projects?
