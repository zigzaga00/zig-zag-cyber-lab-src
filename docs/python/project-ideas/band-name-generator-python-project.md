## 🌀🐍 Project Idea: Make a Band Name Generator!

> _Ready to create the next big band name? Let Python help you dream it up!_

🎸🎸🎸

---

### 🚀 What’s the project?

Code a **Band Name Generator** using Python! When someone runs your program, it will mash together cool words to create random and funny band names! 😃

> Examples:

- **Electric Koala**
- **Glowing Spaghetti**
- **Frozen Bananas**

---

### 🧠 What will I learn?

- How to **store lists of words** in Python
- How to **combine strings** to make new ones
- How to **generate random choices** from a list
- How to **print results** and **ask the user questions**

---

### 🟩 Helpful Feature Cards:

- 🐍 [Feature Card: Build a Random Generator (python)](../feature-cards/random-generator-feature.md)

---

### 🎨 Make It Yours!

Try one or more of these cool twists:

- Add **a question**: “What’s your favourite animal?” — and use that in the name
- Let users **choose a theme**: spooky, space, funny, animals
- Turn it into a **band name quiz**: Ask the user questions about their band then choose a theme for them based on their answers
- Forget the band! 🤯 Why not think about **what else could be generated** using **random words** from **lists**??? A **super-hero generator** perhaps? A **password generator** maybe? Or how about a **book title creator** to serve as **inspiration** for a story?

---

### ⬇️ Simplify It!

Want to make the project **more simple**? Sure, no problem! 😃

Forget using **lists** and **random numbers** for now...try this instead:

- Just `print` two words using `+` or an `f""`
- Get more fancy and get the **user** to `input` two words then `print` them using `+` or an `f""`

### 💡 Extension Challenge:

- Can you make a version that **lets users like band names** with 👍 (1) or 👎 (0) and remembers their likes?
